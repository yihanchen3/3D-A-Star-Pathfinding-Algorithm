# 3D A* Path Finding Algoritnm

This project implements a 3D A* pathfinding algorithm based on C++.
The algorithm finds the shortest path between two input points in a 3D numerical matrix.

### Files and Directories

- **src/main.cpp**

  - This source file contains the `main()` function. It creates an instance of the `Star` class and calls the `Find_path()` method to find the shortest path between two points in the graph.
- **include/Star.h, src/Star.cpp**

  - This header file declares the `Star` class, which implements the A* algorithm. The `Star` class has methods for creating the graph (`Creatgraph()`) and finding the path (`Find_path()`). This source file defines the `Star` class. It includes the implementation of the `Creatgraph()` and `Find_path()` methods.
- **include/Node3D.h**

  -  This header file declares the `Point` structure and the `Node3D` class. The `Point` structure represents a point in 3D space. The `Node3D` class represents a node in the pathfinding graph.
- **.vscode/task.json**

  - Define tasks to automate various development workflows, including building project and running tests.
- **input/input.txt**

  -  This file contains the input numerical (0,1) matrix for the graph, where 0 stands for obstacle and 1 stands for free space.
- **bin/main.exe**

  - This is the executable generated by the compiler, which allows users to input points and receive shortest path.

### Build Instructions

1. Navigate to the project directory
2. Run the `main.cpp` using VSCode. Or Compile the project with g++, and this while generate a executable output:

  ```bash
  g++ .\main.cpp .\Star.cpp .\Node3D.cpp -o ..\bin\main
  ```
4. **Run the executable: `./bin/main.exe`**
5. Input the 3D start point and end point in the graph, and the program will output the shortest path between them. For example:

```bash
Please input the strat point:
1 5 10
Please input the end point:
2 8 16
a path is found 
1 5 10
1 6 11
1 7 12
1 8 13
2 8 14
2 7 15
2 8 16
```
## Note

This project reads the graph data from an input file named `input.txt`. Make sure your input file exists in the 'input/' directory.
The input file is read and converted to **(i= 200, j= 200, k = 30)** 3D numerical matrix. The matrix is stored in the `Star` class as a private member variable. To revise the size of the matrix or change the input file, please change the parameters in `Star.cpp`.
